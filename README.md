- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MaccaSQS

- Just an average lad who has been coding on and off for 8 + years. Owner of Skyquake Studios (My attempt at building an indie game dev studio with friends). Currently partner and partially running the business management / content development of Clashing Blades.

- I have been on a programming hiatus for a while now and besides doing the odd Cisco router configuration and Linux work, i got pretty burned out of coding (C# C++ JAVA, SQL, Visual Basic ;) ). After a long time of reflection i have decided to completely start fresh by focusing my attention on Frontend Web and Python Development. Soon I should hopefully have a portfolio site built, but for now this will have to do :)


- !!! Portfolio coming soon !!!
